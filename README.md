# PopularMovies_1

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org and update it on NetworkUtils.java.
(C:\...\PopularMovies1\app\src\main\java\com\example\android\popularmovies1\utilities\NetworkUtils)

If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. (https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup).

In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.
